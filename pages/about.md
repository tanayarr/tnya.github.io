# **About Me**

Hi I am **Tanaya Rao Raj** :wave:,<br>

I strongly believe in the concept of the 3 R’s (Reduce, Reuse and Re-cycle) and have realized that there is a fourth that exists, that we ignore – ‘Refuse’. These values are an integral part of not only my art but also my life, both slowly merging into unison as everyday experiences, observations and interactions transform into a way of becoming a part of my practice.
