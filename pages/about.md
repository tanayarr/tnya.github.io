# **About Me**

Hi I am **Tanaya Rao Raj** :wave:,<br>

A trained painter, I experiment with various drawing and painting mediums to create my compositions. The visuals are mostly what my 'mind's eye' can see: floating objects, nature, abstracted faces and compositions. The textural quality of the works is enhanced by using day to day found materials and objects such as cement, locks and keys, found discarded surfaces etc. The surfaces often created without any recognisable forms create a world or a *being* of their own.
