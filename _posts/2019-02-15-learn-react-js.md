description: The holes created by bubble wrap impressions obstruct one's vision of what lies behind, ironically at the same time they can be perceived as 'windows' into looking beyond.

Objects on table - Commonplace objects come to life through a quick impasto.

Jal and Aag - Water and fire exist as polar opposites but simultaneously still manage to compliment one another.

Haze - Inspired by Monet's Water Lilies, the composition seems to be a 'hazy' reminder of the artist's series!

Harmony and Discord - Each plane depicted through its respective medium and tool tries to balance out the previous plane, thus creating balance and imbalance. The juxtaposition of regular and irregular forms contributes to create a sense of harmony and discord.

Fleeting - Against the constant blue background, the foreground (or change) is fleeting!

Fade II - The foreground seems to be in the process of getting absorbed and eventually fading into the background.

Fade - The pastel palette reveals the shades of grey that exist within nature. This grey like nature itself possesses a sense of balance in itself.

Camouflage - Amidst the splash of colours, the small patch of newspaper gets camouflaged.
