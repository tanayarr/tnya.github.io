The Garbage Project - Ecologies of the Everyday is an ongoing project initiated by Critical Dialogue Art Space (headed by Ms. Ruchika Wason Singh) in collaboration with artists known to Ms. Ruchika. The first part of the project involved all the artists collecting various kinds of dry waste such as paper bits, wrappers, etc. in a garbage bag assigned to all of them. After 2 months or so, all the artists met at the Critical Dialogues Art Space and deposited their garbage bags. In return, the artists used her garbage to create works followed by a discussion.
