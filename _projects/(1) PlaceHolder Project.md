The video is conceptualized for the piano track titled ‘Hope’ in collaboration with Mr. Anirudh Varma. The video was designed so as to have it play live while the track is performed on stage. Slowly, the visual dissipates as the soundtrack stops.


The artworks were featured in the album ‘Kehsihba’, by Mr. Saptak Chatterjee, a vocalist on his youtube channel. The tracks for which the artworks were made include: Nadi, Wishful Night and the album artwork ‘Kehsihba’.
